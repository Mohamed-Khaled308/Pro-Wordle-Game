# Pro-Wordle-Game:
  Pro-Wordle is an implementation of the Josh Wardleâ€™s word guessing game Wordle. Initially, 
the player is prompted to enter a word and a category to which that word belongs. The game 
then prompts the player to choose a category and the length of the word. The game will select a 
random word belonging to the selected category which is of the selected length. The objective 
then is to try to guess the word which the game has selected. The player has a number of
guesses equal to the chosen length + 1 to guess the word before they lose.
